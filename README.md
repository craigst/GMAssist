GMAssist
========

This program is to make my job easier and faster, allowing more time using phones than editing jobs
This is my first program ever coded before I learned C++ and will be rewriting code (old code will be in own file).

Any help, tips, or advice to make this work better will help as location edits will be huge but hardest to implement also ORC can help with clear downs and marking jobs.
